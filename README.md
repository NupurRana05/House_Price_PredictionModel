# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project is a Machine Learning-based House Price Prediction System for Bangalore, India. It predicts house prices based on key features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms. The project also includes a **Tkinter-based GUI** that allows users to interact with the model in a user-friendly way.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

-  Predicts house prices in Bangalore using a trained ML model
-  Data cleaned, visualized, and processed using Pandas & NumPy
-  Model built using Linear Regression (can be extended to other models)
-  Tkinter GUI for desktop interaction
-  Simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas,NumPy,scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Tkinter â€“ for building the desktop GUI

---

##  How It Works

1. The dataset is cleaned (removing outliers, handling missing values, etc.)
2. One-hot encoding is applied to convert categorical features
3. A linear regression model is trained
4. Tkinter GUI takes user input (e.g., location, BHK, bath, sqft) and displays predicted price
